I trained as an environmental engineer,  but working in the environmental sector does not automatically entail working towards a more sustainable world. 
The first few months of my career in contaminated land left me dissatisfied with the state of sustainable thinking in the industry and I looked elsewhere for employment.

I moved to a small environmental and sustainability consultancy where the company culture celebrated difference, encouraged collaboration and creative thinking, and my input was always valued. It was there I realized that creating a truly sustainable world also means engendering sustainable workplaces and healthy communities.

Technology and computing has always been an interest of mine. But this interest was really kindled when—while working at Syrinx—I saw the need to manage our growing volume of data in a more reliable manner than the (not so trusty) Excel sheet.

So I took the initiative to set up a company-wide environmental data management system. I upskilled in computer science and programming, and took a keen interest in the development of open source solutions for water and environmental monitoring.

Realising in 2013 that I wanted to upskill in order to make real change, I participated in the Centre for Sustainability Leadership (CSL) intensive fellowship program in the first half of 2014. This was a pivotal point in my career, helping me to develop important skills, and reiterating the importance of reflection, thinking, collaboration, and creative processes for effective changemaking and effective design.

Since late 2014 I've been working within the public service, working in the NSW Government to advance the management of our publically-owned water quality and ecological data sets. This has given me the opportunity to broaden the scope of my knowledge of environmental data management and analytical techniques, and to experience a very different view of environmental management that was facilitated by my work in the private sector.
