	<h3>Creativity</h3>
	I'm a creative at heart, with the creative arts forming an important part of my life. I love to push boundaries and step outside my comfort zone to come up with novel, interesting and efficient solutions.

<li class="icon fa-phone">
	<h3>Communication</h3>
	I believe that high-quality work is borne out of good communication. I have been working remotely for most of my career—be it while working in Melbourne with a Perth-based team, or working in the Northern NSW with a state-wide team. I always make made good communication a priority for all my projects and work relationships.

	<h3>Natural world</h3>
	I'm passionate about the environment and sustainability. I love being outdoors and being surrounded by the splendor of the natural world. Which is why I choose to work in a sector that provides such big opportunities for making a difference to the environment, both built and natural.

	<h3>Learning</h3>
	I am deeply committed to ongoing learning, be it practical or theoretical. I have ensured that all new roles, new tasks and new skills that I throw myself into are backed up by high-quality learning and self-development.

	<h3>Making change</h3>
	Throughout my professional life, I continually felt that the primary factor restricting my ability to provide novel sustainability solutions was an entrenched fear of change and risk in institutions and policies. I noticed that design guidelines were focused on adherence to rules rather than outcomes and that more innovative, sustainable solutions—even those with better outcomes—were discouraged because they often didn’t fit with current guidelines. I have a passion for using my skills in engineering, environmental science, technology and community building for to help facilitate change and enable us to move to a more sustainable paradigm.
