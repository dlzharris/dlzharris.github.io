I am an environmental informaticist and engineer with a deep interest in the nexus of environmental science, design and technology, and a passion for creating boundary-pushing sustainability solutions. As a creative, big thinker, with a talent for identifying system connections and interactions, I thrive on collaborative cross-disciplinary work have and a passion for creating boundary-pushing sustainability solutions.

My technical interests lie in the domain of environmental data management, modern computing techniques for solving environmental and sustainability problems, and interoperability, system integration and collaboration in the environmental sector.
